2005-01-15  Karl Runge <runge@karlrunge.com>
	* adjust alpha blending parameters, -alphablend, handle 24bpp.
	* add -snapfb snapshot fb, not clear how useful it is..
	* more functions etc for -pointer_mode 4, still not finished.
	* scan_for_updates() "count only" mode.
	* increase max shm size on Linux.
	* -oa -logappend, -pm, -speeds

	  to opaque pixel.  Options -alphacut, -alphafrac, -alpharemove
	* more commands under remote control: rfbwait, rfbport, http,
	  httpport, httpdir, enablehttpproxy, desktop, alwaysshared,
	  dontdisconnect.  Add to tkx11vnc.

2004-12-22  Karl Runge <runge@karlrunge.com>

	  working on Linux/Xorg and Solaris 10.  disable with -noxfixes
	* remote control mania - nearly everything can be changed dynamically!
	  see the -remote/-query (aka -R/-Q) options. e.g. -R scale:5/6
	* simple gui tkx11vnc based on the remote control mechanism, see -gui
	* support for XRANDR extension, if the X screen changes size (see
	  xrandr(1)), x11vnc will resize the fb. Pays to have NewFBSize viewer

	* renamed NON_CVS to OLD_TREE

2004-08-31  Karl Runge <runge@karlrunge.com>

	* remove old mouse patch code, now use rfbSetCursor (+ workarounds)
	* changed cursor shape options (no more -mouse, ...) to '-cursor mode'

	  corrects ghost "< >" key on pc104 us in XFree86.
	* fix bug wrt no got_keyboard_input under modtweak

2004-07-10  Karl Runge <runge@karlrunge.com>
	* -norepeat to turn off X server autorepeat when clients exist,
	  (this is workaround for the repeating keystroke bug.  Note that
	  client side does autorepeating so not a big loss).

2004-07-04  Karl Runge <runge@karlrunge.com>
	* extend -allow to re-read a file with allowed IP addresses. 
	* improvements to -help text.

2004-07-01  Karl Runge <runge@karlrunge.com>

	  drift in pixel weights and poorer tightvnc compression)
	* add ":pad" scale option, detect small fraction scale = m/n.

2004-06-28  Karl Runge <runge@karlrunge.com>
	* round scaled width to multiple of 4 to make vncviewer happy.

	* add -clear_mods -clear_keys for (rare) case where keys are
	  not being released (e.g. Ctrl-C x11vnc thru x11vnc).
	* export RFB_SERVER_IP and RFB_SERVER_PORT to -accept program
	  so that the tcp 4-tuple is completely specified.  
	* add -storepasswd <pass> <file> so storepasswd program not needed

2004-06-05  Karl Runge <runge@karlrunge.com>

2004-05-08  Karl Runge <runge@karlrunge.com>
	* add -accept some-command/xmessage/popup to prompt local X11 user
	  or otherwise decide to accept an incoming client. 
	* clean up -Wall warnings.

2004-05-05  Karl Runge <runge@karlrunge.com>
	* enable mouse button -> keystrokes mapping in -buttonmap (mousewheel)
	* enable keystroke -> mouse button mapping in -remap (touchpad paste)
	  (-remap incompat ':' -> '-', sorry...)
	* shm OS blacklist (i.e. <= SunOS 5.8) -> -onetile
	* revert to check_user_input() under -nofb
	* cleanup: lastmod, remove tile_shm and update_client_pointer,

	* when threaded: limit rfbMaxClientWait to >= 20 secs and
	  increase it to a huge value unless -rfbwait is supplied.

2004-04-08  Karl Runge <runge@karlrunge.com>
	* added support for blacking out regions of the screen, primarily
	  for Xinerama usage, options: -blackout -xinerama
	* Xinerama workaround mouse problem on 'embedded' system, 
	  option -xwarppointer (XWarpPointer instead of XTEST)

	  use -noprimary to disable polling of PRIMARY selection.

2004-01-19  Karl Runge <runge@karlrunge.com>
	* improvements to pointer event handling primarily during window

	* add "-notruecolor" to force indexed 8bpp color (when 8bpp) 
	* make alias "-forever" for "-many"

From Karl (x11vnc's father) on Apr 2, 2003:
	
New option -nocursor to not display the vncviewer local cursor if user
does not want it (also caused some problems with older vncviewers)

New option -mouse to show the position of the X server mouse (i.e. lagged
from the user's vnc cursor position).  Also: -mouseX will try to show
the a different cursor (X) when on the root background.

New option -many to wait for more connections rather than exiting when
the first client(s) disconnect.

New option -flashcmap to try to follow installed colormaps under 8bpp
indexed color as pointer is moved.

New option -nap to watch for low activity and throttle down the polling
rate.  Useful on shared machines to keep the load down.

Experimental option -id <windowid> to show just that window and not
the whole display.  Some remaining bugs and inconvenient behavior...
(e.g. new toplevels can be unseen)

Fixed bug on multi-headed machines where the screen number was being
ignored in a number of places.

Fixed bug wrt connect_once mode.  Now just refuses new clients unless
shared rather than terminating all clients.

Try to follow changing default colormap under 8bpp indexed color
as color cells are added.

Needed to pick up HAVE_LIBPTHREAD from autoconf.

defined a select() macro for usleep() since usleep is not always thread
safe.

Catch and exit on errors in the shm setup work (XShmCreateImage, shmget,...)
and moved the creation and removal work to separate utility functions.

Added signal and X error handlers to try to clean out the shm objects
before exiting on interrupt, etc.

Improved performance a bit on the memcmp() in scan_display() by checking
the whole line first.

Added a workaround when threaded where libvncserver may disconnect too
early if it does not hear from a client (a small heartbeat is sent).
This may not be needed any longer.

If -desktop has not been prescribed, try to choose a title based on DISPLAY
and the hostname (and window name under -id).
