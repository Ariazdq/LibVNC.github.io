<li>
<a href=http://www.karlrunge.com>Karl Runge</a> took my first version of
x11vnc, which was just a proof-of-concept that the library actually is
usable, and turned it into a <a href=http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/>
fully fledged application</a>.
<li>
Tim Jansen created <a href=http://www.tjansen.de/krfb/>KRFB</a>, which is
x11vnc integrated into KDE.
<li>
Jeff Mock of <a href=http://alfa.naic.edu>the world's largest radio telescope
in Arecibo</a> sent me a nice
<a href=http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net/alfa-vnc.gif>screenshot</a>,
describing his use of LibVNCServer:

<p>

<i>I've been using it for about 4 months
on a project to build a new spectrometer for the radio telescope at
Arecibo.  Arecibo is the largest radio telescope in the world (305m!) in
Puerto Rico. It has 10-times the collecting area of the second largest
telescope in Effelsburg (maybe near you?).

<p>

The project is an embedded linux box that boots from a compact flash
card.  The root filesystem is only about 5MB. X wasn't reasonable
for such a small embedded system, but libvncserver was perfect.  On
the console we run graphical diagnostics that write directly to the
frame buffer.  It was a simple matter to hook this direct-framebuffer
application to libvncserver.  This way we can easily view the
diagnostics for the spectrometer from the control room (or anyplace
else for that matter).</i>

michu let me know that <a href=http://ssl.bulix.org/projects/lcd4linux/>
LCD4Linux</a> has a VNC backend using LibVNCServer.
